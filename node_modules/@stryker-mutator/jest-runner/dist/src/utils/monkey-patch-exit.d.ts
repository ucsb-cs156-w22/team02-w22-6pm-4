/**
 * Jest uses a module called "exit" to exit when using `--bail` mode.
 * It works by monkey-patching the `write` function from stdout and stderr, making the process completely silent, before calling `process.exit` directly.
 * Stryker doesn't play nice with these side effects. In order to fix that, we use this very very very dirty hack to monkey-patch the monkey-patch.
 *
 * It overrides the implementation of `require('exit')` with an empty function. For this to work, it needs to be required before `jest` itself is required.
 * Did I mention this hack is dirty?
